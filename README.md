**NOTE: THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN RETIRED, SINCE THE RESOURCE THIS IS BASED OFF HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED**

This is a simple python script to scrape data from the API of the Onondaga County, NY COVID-19 Cases by Municipality ArcGIS map (https://socpa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/7bd218bc8be04b209c0b80a83fc2eba5) into an easy to read JSON file.
Specifically, the file compiles the number of confirmed, active, and recovered cases, along with deaths, on every day since March 14th.
